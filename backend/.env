# Local MongoDB connection (for Milestone 2)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/tailtrack

# API server port
PORT=4000

# Perfect for local dev as long as:

#- MongoDB is running locally on `127.0.0.1:27017`
#- Database name `tailtrack` is fine (Mongo will create it when you first write)

#Later, when your group moves to **MongoDB Atlas**, this is the only line that changes:

#```env
#MONGODB_URI=<your Atlas connection string>
